            <p>A prototype for a pathfinding made by Rocketsnail in flash 4. It's not specifically confirmed whether this is a prototype for Experimental Penguins or not, as in the forum post in which this was released it says both "Script simular(sic) to the Penguin Chat. Here's the link to one of my old versions in Flash 4.", similar either referring to that it wasn't made for EP, or that it was modified and it was made for EP. You decide.</p>
